            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <p>AVA Rafting & Zipline</p>

            <p class="third">The rule of thirds is based on splitting a picture into nine sections while maintaining picture balance. For this
                website, we can see how the edge of the lake falls perfectly in place with the <br?>
                second horizontal line used to split the picture. Where the tree-line intersects with the mountain above is the 
                top horizontal line. With these in mind it's easy to see how the three vertical columns align with tree-line, title of the
                website, and the water's reflection flows so 'naturally'.

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <p>Target Corporation</p>
            <p class="second"><a href="https://www.target.com/">target.com</a></p>
            <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/460aa2aa-c55d-4d98-a699-e30aec2b9013%2Fthumbnails%2Fvisual-hierarchy.png?1601262731268" />
            <p class="third">Visual hierarchy makes certain areas of a website pop-out to the viewer. As seen in the picture above, the first
                thing that stands out to me is the 14 day sale with the target's logo. To me, this brings a sense of urgency to buy their discounted
               products before the sale ends. By using this approach, Target will get return visitors who want more deals in the future.

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <p>Ford Motor Company</p>
            <p class="second"><a href="https://www.ford.com/">ford.com</a></p>
            <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/460aa2aa-c55d-4d98-a699-e30aec2b9013%2Fthumbnails%2Fwhite-space-and-clean-design.png?1601262733867" />
            <p class="third">As I opened this webpage I was greeted with a country-side view of a guy taking care of some cattle. What the average
                viewer won't see is the marketing behind this photo. What ford is doing, is making it seem like their vehicles can be used to accomplish
                   farm chores, and they set a scene of an open and vibrant landscape. The last thing I noticed was there was only one button to press
                   (besides the nav bar) that will take the customer to learn more about the vehicle in the picture.
